PROFILING ASSIGNMENT

Rachel Lew

COLLABORATION:
    - Josh Pearl: discussing nature of profiling, kcachegrind usage, and
      potential abstraction alteration strategies specifically in reference to
      storing the length of segments as the initial element and true cost of
      the execute_instruction function.

UM ASSEMBLY ANALYSIS:
    Most of the UM execution is spent in build_and_execute_um where the
    instructions are fetched from memory and executed according to their 
    corresponding opcode. Given that the main operation of the UM is being 
    executed here, it makes sense that the majority of the time is spent in 
    this function, and given the nature of these operations namely a large 
    number of function calls the large amount of time this takes seems sound.

    After investigation of the assemby code for this function, it would appear
    that the assembly cannot be changed to further optimize the program.  The
    majority of operations are done in registers with a large proportion of
    them moving local variables into registers appropriate for calling the
    various functions to execute UM instructions. There is one loop within the
    function which retrieves each instruction and executes it, and no
    computations could be removed from this loop to expedite the code.
